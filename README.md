## Innovation

We have implemented a hook which you need to use to overcome the level. If it collides with a wall, it moves the player towards it.

Furthermore, we have added the possibility of attacking and killing the enemies.

## Special mechanics

You can push yourself into the air once for each time you leave the ground. That means double jump when you leave the gound with a hop or one jump if you are already in a free fall.

The hook will only work if it collides perpendicularly with a wall, and it may not be used in GodMode.
