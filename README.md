## Special mechanics

You can push yourself into the air once for each time you leave the ground. That means double jump when you leave the gound with a hop or one jump if you are already in a free fall.

There is a hook you might need to use in order to complete the level. When you throw it, the hook goes horizontally perpendicular to the player, and if it touches a wall it drags the player towards said wall.
