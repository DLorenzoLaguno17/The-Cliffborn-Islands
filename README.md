## Innovation

We have implemented a hook which you need to use to overcome the level. If it collides with a wall, it moves the player towards it, and if it collides with an enemy, it attracts the enemy to the player.


## Special mechanics

You can push yourself into the air once for each time you leave the ground. That means double jump when you leave the gound with a hop or one jump if you are already in a free fall.

The hook will only work if it collides perpendicularly with a wall. Besides, using the hook on the air won't let you move neither backwards nor forwards with A or D keys, and might leave you in the middle of the abyss, so use it wisely. The hook cannot be used in GodMode.
